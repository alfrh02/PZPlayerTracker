This mod adds the ability to track another player using a small text UI as displayed above.

Currently the mod only adds the ability for the host to be the hunter and player 2 (the first player who joins the server) as the huntee.

# How To Use

Simply adding the mod in the server settings will add it to your game.

Once the other player has connected, either player can press the *HOME* key (typically located above the arrow keys) to set the tracker to the other player.
Do not press the HOME key before the other player has connected, it will break the mod.
